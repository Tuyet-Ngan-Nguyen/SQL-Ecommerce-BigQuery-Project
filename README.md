# SQL - Explore Ecommerce Dataset
## I. Introduction
This project contains an eCommerce dataset that I will explore using SQL on [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery). The dataset is based on the Google Analytics public dataset and contains data from an eCommerce website.
## II. Requirements
- Google Cloud Platform account
- Project on Google Cloud Platform
- Google BigQuery API enabled
- SQL query editor or IDE
### III. Dataset Access
The eCommerce dataset is stored in a public Google BigQuery dataset. To access the dataset, follow these steps:

- Log in to your Google Cloud Platform account and create a new project.
- Navigate to the BigQuery console and select your newly created project.
- In the navigation panel, select "Add Data" and then "Search a project".
- Enter the project ID "bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions" and click "Enter".
- Click on the "ga_sessions_" table to open it.
